# Java Solutions to LeetCode Problems

## Quickstart

Run `./mvnw test` (or `mvnw test` if youâ€™re using Windows):

```bash
./mvn test
```

## Runtime Environment

- LeetCode compiles and runs submitted Java code with JDK 17.
- Java 8 features such as lambda expressions and the Streams API can be used.
- Most standard library classes are already imported automatically for convenience.
- The [`javafx.util.Pair`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/util/Pair.html) class is also included.
